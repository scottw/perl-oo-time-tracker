# Perl Object-Orientation

## Purpose

This repo contains Perl code that illustrates some of the differences between "classic" Perl object-orientation and "modern" Perl object-orientation using two classes that could be used to build a primitive time tracking application.

## Audience

The target audience for this is people who write software using classic OO techniques and are interested in testing the modern Perl OO waters.

## Disclaimer

This code is provided as-is. I do not recommend using it as the basis for anything other than its intended purpose to illustrate some of the differences between classic and modern object-oriented Perl. It should not be used as an illustration of good design or best OO practices. Please consult the [Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo) and [Moose](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Moose/lib/Moose/Manual.pod) documentation to learn about the "right way" to do things in these systems.
